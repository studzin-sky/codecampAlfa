     <h2>Here's a brief history about Alfa Romeo GTA. </h2> 
     <p> In 1962, the successor for the very popular Giulietta series 
       was introduced. This car was the Alfa Romeo Giulia, internally called 
       the "Series 105". The coup√© of the 105 series, used the shortened floorpan 
       from the Giulia Berlina and was designed by Bertone. The name of the car evolved from 
       Giulia Sprint GT to Giulia Sprint and to GTJ (Junior) and GTV (Veloce) in the 
       late 1960s. </p>
      <p>At the time, Alfa Romeo was very active in motorsport. Autodelta, the racing 
        division of Alfa, developed a car for competition that closely resembled to the 
        roadgoing model. These cars were named GTA instead of GT, the 'A' standing for "Alleggerita", 
        Italian for lightweight. The GTA was produced first in 1965 as a 1.6 L (1,570 cc) 
        and later as a 1300 Junior version. The GTA automobiles were also manufactured 
        in either street (Stradale) or pure race (Corsa) trim. </p>
